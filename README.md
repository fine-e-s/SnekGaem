# Snek the Gaem

My first experience with programming a fully-functional game. Half of the project was made with the help of Coder Space's video: https://youtu.be/piAgNZ20MJ0. Then I implemented graphics, menu and recod keeping with python's and pygame's documentation and the help of my dear friends Danil Astakhov and Evgeny Karkhanov. Enjoy!
